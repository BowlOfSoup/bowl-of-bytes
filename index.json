[{"content":"Needed to use a Raspberry Pi 2 for a project, but the installed version of Rasbian was too old. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I upgraded it manually without access to an SD-card reader to install a new version.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve set out on a quest to build myself a homelab, with some network infrastructure. I have an old Raspberry PI 2, with 1GB of RAM and a ARMv7 1200Mhz processor which I indent to use as a VPN gateway.\nI booted up the Raspberry, and used the recovery mode to reset the OS to its original, which was Raspbian Jessie. Jessie is not supported anymore and can pose a security risk, so I wanted to upgrade it to the latest version of Raspbian: Bookworm.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t have an SD-card reader, so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t just flash a new image to the SD-card. No problem! We can just manually upgrade.\nSince Raspbian installs with a GUI, lets get rid of that first. With Ctrl+Alt+1 we can switch to a terminal. Login with pi and password raspberry. You should change this later ;)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 sudo apt purge --auto-remove \\ raspberrypi-ui-mods lxpanel lxappearance openbox lightdm xserver* \\ libreoffice* gvfs* desktop-base pix* gnome* gpicview xarchiver \\ chromium* x11-xserver-util xserver-xorg libx11-* wolfram-engine xarchiver \\ xfont* desktop-base openjdk-11-jdk libgtk2* libgtk* imagemagick* \\ gnome-icon-theme adwaita-icon-theme qt-* qt5* xpdf* *wayland* ⚠️️ There is probably a better way to do this, but this worked for me.\nNow for the upgrading process, upgrading directly to the newest version is not recommended because of the huge amount of changes in dependencies.\nSince we\u0026rsquo;re working with Jessie we can\u0026rsquo;t use the configured repository, since it\u0026rsquo;s no longer available.\n→ Remove all other lines, and add this one to /etc/apt/sources.list:\n1 deb http://legacy.raspbian.org/raspbian/ jessie main contrib non-free rpi → Run the following commands to update all the Jessie packages:\n1 2 3 4 sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade -y sudo apt dist-upgrade -y sudo apt-get autoremove -y → Now we can upgrade to Stretch. Change /etc/apt/sources.list to this line:\n1 deb http://legacy.raspbian.org/raspbian/ stretch main contrib non-free rpi → Replace jessie with stretch in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list files, and upgrade away:\n1 2 3 4 5 sudo sed -i \u0026#39;s/jessie/stretch/g\u0026#39; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade -y sudo apt dist-upgrade -y sudo apt-get autoremove -y → Repeat the same to upgrade to Buster; in /etc/apt/sources.list:\n1 deb http://legacy.raspbian.org/raspbian/ buster main contrib non-free rpi → Then run:\n1 2 3 4 5 sudo sed -i \u0026#39;s/stretch/buster/g\u0026#39; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade -y sudo apt dist-upgrade -y sudo apt-get autoremove -y → Again, repeat the same to upgrade to Bullseye; in /etc/apt/sources.list:\n1 deb http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/ bullseye main contrib non-free rpi → Then run:\n1 sudo sed -i \u0026#39;s/buster/bullseye/g\u0026#39; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list To upgrade to Bullseye, we manually have to remove the ui repo from the *.list files, since it\u0026rsquo;s not available anymore.\n→ Edit every file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ and remove the ui string.\n→ Now run the following, and pay attention to installing gcc-8-base:\n1 2 3 4 5 sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade -y sudo apt install gcc-8-base sudo apt dist-upgrade -y sudo apt-get autoremove -y And lastly, we can upgrade to Bookworm. In /etc/apt/sources.list:\n1 deb http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/ bookworm main contrib non-free rpi → Now for the last time :)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 sudo sed -i \u0026#39;s/bullseye/bookworm/g\u0026#39; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade -y sudo apt dist-upgrade -y sudo apt-get autoremove -y sudo reboot And there you have it! A Raspberry Pi 2, manually upgraded to the latest version of Raspbian. Verify this by running cat /etc/os-release, and you should see:\n1 PRETTY_NAME=\u0026#34;Raspbian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)\u0026#34; ","permalink":"https://bowlofbytes.com/posts/manually-upgrading-a-raspberry-pi-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNeeded to use a Raspberry Pi 2 for a project, but the installed version of Rasbian was too old.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how I upgraded it manually without access to an SD-card reader to install a new version.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Manually upgrading a Raspberry Pi 2"}]
